# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This is my first GitHub project which I have developed as part of my training on the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Course.

### Technologies Used
1. CLI commands to create, track/untrack, add, commit and push changes
2. Linked to my GitHub account
3. Used "rm" command to remove password.txt from tracked files
4. Amended template README.md
